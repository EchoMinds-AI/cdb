## Performance Verification

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If the page doesn't load at all:
1. Verify DNS propagation using a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
2. Check that your web hosting server is running
3. Ensure the files are in the correct directory on your server

### If the page loads but looks broken:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all files in the `_next` directory were uploaded correctly
3. Make sure the file permissions allow the web server to read the files

### If some functionality doesn't work:
1. Ensure all JavaScript files were uploaded with the correct structure
2. Check that your web server is configured to serve the correct MIME types
3. Verify there are no content security policies blocking script execution
